# Probabilistic-Key-Profiling
Towards key profiling on probabilistic database using MapReduce 

This is related to my thesis implementation which is about data profiling in probabilistic database. I am using knowledge discovery algorithm in probabilistic database to understand the probability of each subset of attributes being a key for the possible worlds in the data set. Probabilistic data sets come with different possible worlds(relations), it leads to a big data set. And so implementing the algorithm in map reduce programming model for multiprocessors.
